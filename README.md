(1): 	 A Java program to implement a Stack data structure using the Linked list data structure.
The required program needs to fulfill the following requirements
Create a Node (Student) class to save the information (name and marks) of a student
Create one or multiple stacks to save students data into the stack(s)
Use a linked list data structure for the implementation of a stack.
Take the choice of operation from the user and perform the following operations which depend
on the choice
1. To add a student to Stack
2. To remove a Student from the Stack.
3. Display all students of Stack.
4. Display the top 3 positions of students. (The student with the highest marks is in first place positions  
      are according to the same highest marks criteria)

5. Press 5 or any other key to close the program

Important Notes:
The Stack must be implemented using a Linked list data structure Stack implementation math array will not be considered and will be awarded with Zero Marks Only classes are allowed to be used for student (Node) 
You can use only stack to save the information of top students. Any other data structure, array, or variables are not allowed
